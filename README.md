## 💡 Why It Matters

This case study showcases how I approach product thinking, engagement strategy, and data storytelling. Though focused on a gaming product, the methodology is directly transferable to **ecommerce, SaaS, digital media, and consumer analytics** roles.

Let’s build better products with data.
